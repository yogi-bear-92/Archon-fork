        'model_state': self.network.state_dict(),
        'optimizer_state': self.optimizer.state_dict(),
        'config': self.config,
        'performance_history': list(self.performance_history)
    }, path)

def load_model(self, path: str):
    checkpoint = torch.load(path, map_location=self.device)
    self.network.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state'])
    self.optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['optimizer_state'])
```
