 * Radix UI Primitives with Glassmorphism Styling

 * This is our design system foundation for the /features directory.
 * All new components in features should use these primitives.
 *
 * Migration strategy:
 * - Old components in /components use legacy custom UI
 * - New components in /features use these Radix primitives
 * - Gradually migrate as we refactor
