# The Neural Trading Trials Challenge

**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Reward:** 500 rUv  
**Challenge ID:** TBD  

## Description

The Neural Trading Trials is an advanced AI trading challenge that tests your ability to build sophisticated trading algorithms using neural network concepts and market analysis techniques.

## Requirements

1. **Neural Network Architecture**: Implement a multi-layer neural network for market prediction
2. **Technical Indicators**: Integrate RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands for market analysis
3. **Risk Management**: Implement position sizing and stop-loss mechanisms
4. **Backtesting**: Create a comprehensive backtesting system with performance metrics
5. **Real-time Simulation**: Build a real-time trading simulation engine

## Key Features

- **Multi-layer Perceptron**: 3-layer neural network with configurable hidden layers
- **Advanced Technical Analysis**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and moving averages
- **Risk Management**: Dynamic position sizing based on volatility and confidence
- **Performance Metrics**: Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, win rate, profit factor
- **Real-time Trading**: Live simulation with market data streaming

## Implementation

The solution includes:
- `NeuralTradingTrials` class with complete trading system
- `NeuralNetwork` class for market prediction
- `TechnicalIndicators` class for market analysis
- `RiskManager` class for position and risk management
- `Backtester` class for historical performance analysis
- `TradingSimulator` class for real-time simulation

## Usage
