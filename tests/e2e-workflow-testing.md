# Comprehensive End-to-End Workflow Testing for Archon Ecosystem

## Testing Strategy Overview

This document outlines systematic end-to-end testing across all Archon components:
- Project Management Workflow
- MCP Integration Workflow  
- RAG and Knowledge Management
- Real-time Features
- Data Persistence
- Authentication Flow

## Current System Status

Based on initial health checks:

| Service | Container | Port | Status | Health |
|---------|-----------|------|--------|---------|
| Backend API | archon-server | 8181 | ✅ Running | ✅ Healthy |
| MCP Server | archon-mcp | 8051 | ✅ Running | ✅ Healthy |
| Frontend UI | archon-ui | 3737 | ✅ Running | ✅ Healthy |
| Lunar MCPX | archon-lunar-mcpx | 8050/8090 | ⚠️ Running | ❌ Unhealthy |

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Core API Testing
1. Health endpoint validation
2. Database connectivity
3. Basic CRUD operations
4. Authentication validation

### Phase 2: Project Management Workflow
1. Project creation via API
2. Task management operations
3. Project listing and filtering
4. Cleanup and deletion

### Phase 3: MCP Integration Testing
1. Tool discovery through MCPX gateway
2. Archon PRP tool execution
3. Claude Flow tool execution
4. Serena tool execution
5. Error handling and recovery

### Phase 4: Knowledge Management (RAG)
1. Document ingestion
2. Vector storage validation
3. Semantic search testing
4. Query execution and retrieval

### Phase 5: Real-time Features
1. Socket.IO connection testing
2. Live updates validation
3. Event propagation
4. Connection stability

### Phase 6: Data Persistence
1. Database transaction integrity
2. Data consistency across services
3. Backup/recovery procedures
