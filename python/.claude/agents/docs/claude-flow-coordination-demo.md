# Claude Flow Multi-Agent Coordination Demo

## ðŸŽ¯ Full-Stack Development Orchestration

### Agent Coordination Strategy

```yaml
Swarm Architecture:
  Topology: Mesh Network (Peer-to-Peer)
  Max Agents: 8
  Strategy: Adaptive
  Memory: Shared Coordination Cache

Agent Assignments:
  System Architect: API design & database modeling
  React Developer: Frontend components & state management  
  Backend Developer: Node.js/Express API implementation
  Database Engineer: PostgreSQL schema & optimization
  Security Specialist: Authentication & authorization
  Test Engineer: Unit/Integration/E2E testing
  DevOps Engineer: CI/CD pipeline & deployment
  Performance Analyst: Monitoring & optimization
```

### Coordination Protocol

**Phase 1: Planning & Architecture**
- System Architect: Designs overall architecture
- Research Agent: Analyzes best practices from knowledge base
- Memory coordination: Store architectural decisions

**Phase 2: Parallel Development**
- Frontend & Backend agents work concurrently
- Shared memory for API contracts and data models
- Real-time coordination via Claude Flow hooks

**Phase 3: Integration & Testing**
- Test agents validate all components
- Performance analysis and optimization
- Security review and hardening

## ðŸ§  RAG Integration with Archon Knowledge Base

### Knowledge Sources Retrieved:
1. **Authentication Patterns**: JWT implementation with refresh tokens
2. **API Design**: RESTful patterns with proper error handling  
3. **Database Optimization**: N+1 query prevention strategies
4. **React Patterns**: State management and component architecture
5. **Testing Strategies**: London vs Chicago school approaches

### Progressive Refinement Cycles:
```
Cycle 1: Basic implementation
Cycle 2: Security hardening  
Cycle 3: Performance optimization
Cycle 4: Production readiness
```
