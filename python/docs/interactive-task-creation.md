# Interactive Task Creation System

## Overview

The Interactive Task Creation System transforms the automated approach into a user-guided, conversational workflow. Instead of automatically creating tasks, the system:

1. **üîç Detects potential tasks** in user messages using AI analysis
2. **‚ùì Asks for user confirmation** before proceeding with task creation
3. **üí¨ Gathers additional details** through intelligent questions
4. **‚úÖ Creates tasks only when users explicitly confirm** with complete information

This approach ensures users have full control over what tasks are created while still benefiting from AI assistance in task analysis and requirement gathering.

## Architecture

## Key Components

### 1. Interactive Task Service (`interactive_task_service.py`)

**Purpose**: Core orchestration service managing the conversational task creation workflow.

**Key Features**:
- **Session Management**: Tracks user conversations through state machine
- **AI-Powered Question Generation**: Creates relevant questions based on task context
- **Progressive Detail Gathering**: Builds comprehensive task specifications iteratively
- **State Persistence**: Maintains conversation state between user interactions

**Workflow States**:
```python
class TaskCreationState(str, Enum):
    INITIAL_DETECTION = "initial_detection"      # AI detects potential task
    USER_CONFIRMATION = "user_confirmation"     # Ask user if they want task
    GATHERING_DETAILS = "gathering_details"     # Ask clarifying questions
    FINAL_CONFIRMATION = "final_confirmation"   # Show final task for approval
    TASK_CREATED = "task_created"               # Task successfully created
    USER_DECLINED = "user_declined"             # User declined task creation
```

### 2. Interactive Task API (`interactive_task_api.py`)

**Purpose**: REST API endpoints for managing interactive task creation sessions.

**Key Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/interactive-tasks/detect` - Detect tasks and start session
- `POST /api/interactive-tasks/respond` - Process user responses
- `GET /api/interactive-tasks/sessions` - List active sessions
- `DELETE /api/interactive-tasks/sessions/{id}` - Cancel session

### 3. Enhanced Hook Scripts

#### Post-User-Prompt Hook (`post_user_prompt_hook.py`)
- **Purpose**: Entry point that analyzes user messages for tasks
- **New Behavior**: Creates interactive sessions instead of auto-creating tasks
- **Output**: Provides Claude Code with confirmation questions for users

#### Interactive Response Hook (`interactive_task_response_hook.py`)
- **Purpose**: Processes user responses during task creation conversations
- **Usage**: Called manually when users respond to task creation prompts
- **Workflow**: Advances sessions through states until completion or cancellation

## Interactive Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Simple Task Confirmation

**User**: "Can you implement user authentication with JWT tokens?"

**System Response**:
```
I detected a potential task: Implement JWT Authentication System

Description: Create JWT-based authentication with login, logout, and token management functionality.

Would you like me to help you create this as a task in your project? (yes/no)
```

**User**: "yes"

**System**: ‚úÖ Task created successfully! The task has been added to your project.

### Example 2: Complex Task with Questions

**User**: "We need to build a dashboard for our app"

**System Response**:
```
I detected a potential task: Build Application Dashboard

Would you like me to help you create this as a task? (yes/no)
```

**User**: "yes"

**System Questions**:
```
Great! I'd like to gather some more details:

1. What specific data should the dashboard display (analytics, user metrics, system status, etc.)?
2. Who will be the primary users of this dashboard (admins, managers, end users)?
3. Do you need real-time updates or is periodic refresh sufficient?
4. Are there any specific technologies or frameworks you'd prefer to use?
```

**User**: "The dashboard should show user analytics, system performance metrics, and recent activity logs. It's for administrators and should have real-time updates."

**System Final Confirmation**:
```
Perfect! Here's the task I'll create:

**Title**: Build Admin Dashboard with Real-time Analytics

**Description**: Create a comprehensive admin dashboard displaying user analytics, system performance metrics, and activity logs. Must support real-time updates and be optimized for administrative use.

*Note: The coordinator agent will automatically assign this task to the most appropriate team member based on the requirements.*

Should I create this task? (yes/no)
```

**User**: "yes"

**System**: ‚úÖ Task created successfully!

### Example 3: User Declines

**User**: "Maybe we should add some caching"

**System**:
```
I detected a potential task: Implement Caching System

Would you like me to create this as a task? (yes/no)
```

**User**: "no, not right now"

**System**: No problem! I won't create a task. Let me know if you change your mind.

     -d '{
       "session_id": "task_session_20241206_143022",
       "user_response": "yes, please create this task"
     }'
```

## Session Management

### Session States

1. **USER_CONFIRMATION**: Waiting for user to confirm task creation
2. **GATHERING_DETAILS**: Asking clarifying questions
3. **FINAL_CONFIRMATION**: Showing complete task for final approval
4. **TASK_CREATED**: Task successfully created
5. **USER_DECLINED**: User declined task creation

### Session Cleanup

- **Automatic**: Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Manual**: Users can cancel sessions via API
- **On Completion**: Sessions are automatically cleaned up when tasks are created or declined

## Intelligence Features

### Smart Question Generation

The system uses GPT-4o to generate contextually relevant questions:

**Question Categories**:
- **Scope & Requirements**: "What specific features should be included?"
- **Technical Approach**: "Which technologies or frameworks should be used?"
- **User Experience**: "Who will use this and how?"
- **Priority & Timeline**: "How urgent is this task?"
- **Dependencies**: "What other systems does this depend on?"

### Adaptive Detail Gathering

- **Progressive Questions**: Asks follow-up questions based on previous answers
- **Context Awareness**: Considers project context and conversation history
- **Completeness Check**: Stops asking when sufficient information is gathered
- **Fallback Logic**: Proceeds with available information if AI fails

### Final Task Enhancement

The system creates comprehensive task specifications by combining:
- Original user message
- Conversation context
- Gathered requirements
- Best practices for task documentation

## Integration with Archon
