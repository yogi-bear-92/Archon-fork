# Comment-Driven Automatic Fix System

This system provides comprehensive automated fixes triggered by PR/issue comments with GitHub swarm agent coordination.

## 🤖 Available Fix Commands

Simply add these commands as comments in GitHub PRs or issues to trigger automated fixes:

### Core Commands
- **`/fix-containers`** - Fix Docker startup issues, health checks, dependencies
- **`/fix-lint`** - Apply black, isort, flake8 formatting and fixes
- **`/fix-types`** - Add type hints and resolve mypy issues
- **`/fix-security`** - Address bandit and safety security findings
- **`/fix-tests`** - Fix failing tests and improve test coverage
- **`/fix-deps`** - Update dependencies and resolve version conflicts
- **`/fix-docs`** - Generate API docs and update README files
- **`/fix-performance`** - Optimize bottlenecks and add caching
- **`/fix-workflows`** - Fix GitHub Actions workflow issues
- **`/fix-all`** - Run comprehensive automated fixing (all categories)

## 🔐 Authorization

Only the following users can trigger automated fixes:
- Repository owner (`yogi-bear-92`)
- Collaborators with write access
- Members of the organization
- Dependabot for security updates

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Comment Detection**: GitHub Actions monitors PR/issue comments
2. **Command Parsing**: System identifies fix commands and validates authorization
3. **Agent Spawning**: Claude Flow swarm agents are deployed for coordination
4. **Fix Execution**: Specialized fix scripts run with safety validation
5. **Progress Updates**: Real-time status updates posted as comment reactions and replies
6. **Safety Checks**: All changes validated before committing
7. **Rollback**: Automatic rollback if validation fails

## 🚦 Status Indicators

The system uses GitHub reactions and comments to indicate progress:

| Reaction | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| 👀 | Command recognized and authorized |
| ⚡ | Fix process started |
| ✅ | Fix completed successfully |
| ❌ | Fix failed or validation error |
| 🚧 | Fix in progress |

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Validation System
- **Syntax Validation**: Code syntax checked before commit
- **Test Execution**: Test suite runs to verify changes
- **Security Scanning**: Changes scanned for new vulnerabilities
- **Rollback Capability**: Automatic revert if validation fails

### Authorization Levels
```yaml
Repository Owner: All commands allowed
Collaborators: All commands except dangerous operations  
Contributors: Limited to safe commands (lint, docs, tests)
External Users: No access (commented but not executed)
```

### Change Isolation
- Each fix runs in isolated environment
- Changes committed separately for easy rollback
- Detailed commit messages with fix metadata
- Pull request integration for review

## 🔧 Manual Usage

Fix scripts can also be run manually:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/Archon-fork/python

# Run individual fixes
./scripts/fixes/fix-lint.sh
./scripts/fixes/fix-security.sh
./scripts/fixes/fix-tests.sh

# Run comprehensive fixes
./scripts/fixes/fix-all.sh

# Make scripts executable (if needed)
chmod +x scripts/fixes/*.sh
```

## 📈 Monitoring and Reporting

### Real-time Updates
- Comment reactions for immediate feedback
- Progressive status comments during execution
- Detailed completion reports with change summaries

### Metrics Collection
- Fix success/failure rates

### Reports Generated
- `automated-fix-report.md` - Comprehensive fix results
- `performance-report.md` - Performance improvements
- `dependency-report.md` - Dependency update summary

## 🧠 Swarm Agent Coordination

The system uses Claude Flow for intelligent agent coordination:

### Agent Types
- **Container Agent**: Docker and infrastructure fixes
- **Security Agent**: Vulnerability scanning and fixes
- **Quality Agent**: Code formatting and linting
- **Test Agent**: Test generation and fixes
- **Performance Agent**: Optimization and caching
- **Documentation Agent**: API docs and README updates

### Coordination Features
- **Memory-aware scaling**: Agents adapt to system resources
- **Priority queuing**: Critical fixes run first
- **Error recovery**: Automatic retry with fallback strategies
- **Resource management**: Memory and CPU usage optimization

## 🚨 Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Fix command not responding:**
- Check if user is authorized
- Verify command syntax (must be exact)
- Look for GitHub Actions workflow errors

**Fix failed during execution:**
- Check the detailed error in GitHub Actions logs
- Verify all dependencies are available
- Manual fixes may be needed for complex issues

**Changes committed but tests failing:**
- System has automatic rollback capability
- Check rollback was successful in git history
- May require manual intervention for complex conflicts

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Stop running fixes**: Cancel GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Rollback changes**: Use git reset or revert
3. **Check system status**: Verify repository integrity
4. **Report issues**: Create GitHub issue with error details

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Systems

### Archon PRP Framework
- Progressive refinement applied to fixes
- Multi-agent coordination for complex changes
