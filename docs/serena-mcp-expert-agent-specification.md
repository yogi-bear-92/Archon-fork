    return synthesize_context()
```

**Adaptive Memory Management:**
```python
# Smart memory lifecycle
def manage_memory_lifecycle():
    # Regular cleanup of stale information
    outdated_memories = identify_outdated_context()
    for memory in outdated_memories:
        delete_memory(memory.name)
    
    # Consolidate related memories
