#### Step 3: Agent Coordination Workflow

Each agent follows the integration protocol:

**Archon Master Agent Execution:**
```python
async def orchestrate_enterprise_knowledge_system():
    # Pre-task coordination
    await execute_hook("npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description 'Enterprise Knowledge Management Setup'")
    
    # Initialize Archon project
    project = await mcp_client.create_project(
        title="Enterprise Knowledge Management System",
        description="Comprehensive knowledge system for 500+ engineers",
        github_repo="https://github.com/company/knowledge-system"
    )
    
    # Generate initial tasks with AI assistance
    tasks = await mcp_client.create_task(
        project_id=project.id,
        title="System Architecture Design",
        description="Design scalable architecture for enterprise knowledge management",
        assignee="archon-master",
        feature="architecture"
    )
    
    # Store coordination context
    await execute_hook(f"npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-store --key 'archon/enterprise/context' --value '{project.context}'")
    
    # Coordinate specialized agents
    coordination_plan = await self.generate_coordination_plan(project, tasks)
    
    # Monitor progress and adjust
    while not project.completed:
        progress = await self.monitor_agent_progress()
        await self.adjust_coordination_strategy(progress)
        await asyncio.sleep(60)  # Check every minute
    
    # Post-task completion
    await execute_hook("npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id '{tasks.id}' --success true")
    
    return project
```

**RAG Specialist Agent Execution:**
```python
async def implement_enterprise_rag_system():
    # Retrieve coordination context
    context = await retrieve_memory("archon/enterprise/context")
    
    # Implement multi-strategy RAG
    rag_config = {
        "contextual_embeddings": {
            "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
            "dimensions": 1536,
            "context_window": 8192
        },
        "hybrid_search": {
            "vector_weight": 0.7,
            "bm25_weight": 0.3,
            "reranker": "cross-encoder"
        },
        "agentic_rag": {

            "multi_step_reasoning": True,
            "citation_tracking": True
        }
    }
    
    # Implement and optimize
    performance_metrics = await self.implement_rag_strategies(rag_config)
    
    # Share results with team
    await execute_hook(f"npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --message 'RAG implementation complete: {performance_metrics.summary}'")

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Performance Optimization

**Slow RAG Queries:**
```python
async def optimize_rag_performance():
    # Implement caching strategies
    await setup_multi_level_caching()
    
    # Optimize vector operations  
    await optimize_pgvector_indexes()
    
    # Implement query batching
    await enable_query_batching()
    
    # Monitor and tune
    metrics = await collect_performance_metrics()
    return await auto_tune_parameters(metrics)
```

**Memory Management:**
```python
async def optimize_memory_usage():
    # Implement memory pooling
    await setup_memory_pools()
    
    # Configure garbage collection
    await optimize_gc_settings()
    
    # Monitor memory leaks
    await setup_memory_monitoring()
```

### Integration Issues

**MCP Connection Failures:**
```python
async def handle_mcp_failures():
    # Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
    retry_config = {
        "max_retries": 5,
        "base_delay": 1.0,
        "max_delay": 30.0,
        "exponential_factor": 2.0
    }
    
    # Fallback to cached data
    if await mcp_connection_failed():
        return await fallback_to_cache()
    
    # Circuit breaker pattern
    return await implement_circuit_breaker()
```

## Deployment Best Practices

### Production Checklist

- ✅ **Environment Configuration**: All secrets properly managed
- ✅ **Database Optimization**: Indexes, connection pooling, replication
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and alerting
- ✅ **Security**: Authentication, authorization, rate limiting
- ✅ **Performance**: Caching, CDN, query optimization
- ✅ **Backup**: Automated backups and disaster recovery
- ✅ **Documentation**: API docs, runbooks, troubleshooting guides

### Scaling Considerations

```yaml
Horizontal Scaling:
  - Load balancers for API endpoints
  - Database read replicas
  - Redis cluster for caching
  - Message queue for async processing

Vertical Scaling:
  - CPU optimization for compute-heavy tasks
  - Memory scaling for large datasets
  - Storage optimization for media content
  - Network optimization for real-time features
```
