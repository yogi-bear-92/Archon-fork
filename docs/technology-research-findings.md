- Serena as semantic intelligence service (port 8051) 
- Claude Flow as coordination orchestration layer
- FastAPI main service as integration hub (port 8080)

#### 1.2 Core Orchestration Patterns
**Microsoft-Identified Patterns:**
- **Sequential**: Tasks processed in order (suitable for PRP cycles)
- **Concurrent**: Parallel task handling (ideal for Claude Flow swarms)
- **Group Chat**: Collaborative agent discussion (Serena + Archon coordination)
- **Handoff**: Specialized agent work transfer (SPARC phase transitions)
- **Magentic**: Dynamic agent selection based on context (capability matrix routing)

#### 1.3 Specialization Architecture
**Best Practice:** Role-based agent design where each agent has specific capabilities
- Document_Agent: Orchestrates document workflows
- RAG_Agent: Manages knowledge retrieval refinement
- Task_Agent: Handles project management workflows  
- Claude Flow Expert: Multi-agent coordination specialist

### Performance Considerations
**Token Economics:** Multi-agent systems consume significant tokens but provide 80% variance explanation in problem-solving capability. Cost-benefit analysis shows value for complex development tasks.

**Coordination Complexity:** Industry data shows 60% reduction in deployment issues when using containerized agent services.
